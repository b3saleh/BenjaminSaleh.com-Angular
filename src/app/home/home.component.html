        About me
      </h3>
      Born in Buffalo and raised in Canada and France, I am now returning to the US with an education and a diverse cultural background.
      A recent graduate of the University of Waterloo's Electrical engineering program, I am starting off my professional career in San Francisco where I'm hoping to enjoy the culture as well as the weather.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      When it comes to my time off, I am naturally drawn to music and sports.
      I love to blend these hobbies with my electrical engineering experience through my personal projects.
      So far I have created a tryout tracking app for sports (

      DreamTeam is a tryout manager that was designed for the University of Waterloo Ultimate Frisbee team to provide the coaches and captains with a way to track athleteâ€™s performance and development in a tryout setting. When a team is hosting tryouts, coaches and captains need to evaluate various athletes and later access that information to build a strong and balanced team and DreamTeam is here to help.

      BackBeat is a performance drum machine designed for musicians and buskers.
      <br/>
      Tap sensors are used to help you record your drum beat, a micro-controller will continuously repeat the beat exactly how you played it and finally, a surface actuator will use your the body of your guitar as an amplifier to play your beat as you play your song. Battery powered and compact design allows you to take it anywhere.
